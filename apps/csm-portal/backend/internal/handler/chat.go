// Package handler — this file implements the live-engineer-chat escalation
// feature: a customer in the Novera AI chat (customer-portal) asks for a
// human, and an available engineer here (csm-portal) picks it up.
//
// Design, and why it looks the way it does:
//
//   - A "chat message" during a live session is persisted via LOCAL
//     STAND-IN routing-service tables (work_item/chat_conversation/comment
//     inside chat-routing-service's own database — see routingService's
//     AddComment/CreateWorkItem and that service's internal/router/
//     workitem.go) rather than entity-service, since entity-service's real
//     generic work-item schema isn't ready yet (see the project's
//     chat-persistence-mapping-plan.md doc) and entity's CreateCaseComment
//     never worked for the customer's half of the conversation anyway (no
//     x-user-id-token on that internal call). See HandleCustomerMessage/
//     HandleEngineerMessage.
//   - "Accepting" a session is just PATCH /cases/{id} with assigneeEmail —
//     no separate claim/lock table, no SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED.
//     First engineer to click Accept wins via a normal update. At this
//     project's current scale (a handful of engineers) the race this could
//     lose to essentially never happens; if it ever matters, atomic claiming
//     is a small, isolated follow-up.
//   - Which case a browser message belongs to travels as an explicit
//     conversationId/caseId pair on every request — this handler keeps no
//     server-side session table mapping one to the other. customer-portal's
//     escalate call already knows both: no entity-service case exists yet
//     under chat-first escalation, so it sends its own conversationId as
//     caseId too (the two stay equal until conversion — see
//     HandleConvertToCase and backend-v2's own escalation handler). Every
//     subsequent engineer-side call carries the conversationId the original
//     SSE alert included.
//   - Engineer presence for "is anyone connected at all" still has no
//     heartbeat/presence table — that's still derived from who has
//     GET /chat/alerts/stream open (see chat_stream.go). What an engineer's
//     dropdown shows (Available/Busy/Offline), though, is now real state,
//     owned by the standalone chat-routing-service (see
//     internal/routingclient) rather than inferred.
//
// Delivery of a routed event to a specific engineer, and the broadcast
// fallback:
//
//   - Customer → engineers: an escalation is routed to exactly one engineer
//     by the routing service (internal/routingclient.Client.Escalate) and
//     delivered over that engineer's own SSE subscription key (see
//     engineerHubKey, chat_stream.go). If the routing service is down or
//     errors, HandleEscalate falls back to the pre-routing behavior —
//     publishing on the shared broadcastHubKey every connected engineer's
//     stream also subscribes to (see StreamEngineerAlerts's dual
//     registration) — so a routing-service outage doesn't strand the
//     customer with nobody ever seeing their request.
//   - Engineer → customer: relayed by pushing into customer-portal/
//     backend-v2's already-open per-conversation WebSocket (see
//     internal/chatnotify), because that connection already exists for the
//     life of the chat — there is no reason to also fan this out over SSE.
