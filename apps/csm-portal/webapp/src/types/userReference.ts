/**
 * UI-facing mirror of the backend's `UserReference` schema (see
 * `BeUserReference` in `api/backend/types.ts`): id, email and display name,
 * nothing else. Every person-valued field the backend returns now carries one
 * of these as a sibling of whatever it returned before.
 *
 * `id` is nullable — populated only where the backing data source already
 * resolved the actor to a user record. When it's null but `email` looks like
 * a real address, {@link UserRefLink} resolves it through the cached
 * email-to-id lookup (`useResolvedUserId`) rather than blocking render on it.
