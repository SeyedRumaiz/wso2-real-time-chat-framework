 * not a query param) so a specific dashboard/team view is shareable. The
 * selected team scopes widget data client-side via the
 * `__current_team__` filter placeholder (see `teamFilterPlaceholder.ts`) —
 * the parent resolves the selected team's own `groupId` and threads it down
 * to the widget grid. The earlier My ABT / All customers toggle was removed
 * entirely — ABT scoping was never implemented and dashboards carry no
 * other special behavior beyond which one (and, for team-based ones, which
