/**
 * Merges a pie/bar widget's per-slice `filters` under its own base `filters`
 * (see `PieSlice`'s doc comment on the backend: "slice keys win on
 * conflict"), the way `useWidgetPieData`/`DashboardWidgetTile`'s click-through
 * both need.
 *
 * For every resourceType except `case`, filters are a flat
 * `{ [namedField]: values }` record, so a plain object spread already gives
 * "slice keys win on conflict" for free — the slice's own keys simply
 * overwrite the base's same-named keys, and every other base key survives.
 *
 * `case` widgets carry the generic field/op/values DSL nested under a single
 * `filters` array property (`{ filters: BeCaseFieldFilter[] }`). A plain
 * object spread there is wrong: both objects have exactly one key
 * (`"filters"`), so the slice's array would silently replace the base's
 * array wholesale instead of overriding just the fields it actually
 * specifies — e.g. a "Critical" severity slice would lose the widget's own
 * base state filter entirely, and start counting cases in every state, not
 * just the open/in-progress ones the base widget itself is scoped to. This
 * function detects that shape and merges the two arrays by `field`, keeping
 * every base entry whose field the slice doesn't itself specify.
 */
/** Same shape check as `isCaseFieldFilterArray`, but also accepts a
 * genuinely empty array — a slice or base widget legitimately carrying zero
 * extra filter conditions is not the same as "not this shape at all", and
 * must still trigger the array-merge path below rather than the naive
 * fallback spread (which would otherwise wipe out the other side's
 * non-empty array whenever one side happens to be empty). */
