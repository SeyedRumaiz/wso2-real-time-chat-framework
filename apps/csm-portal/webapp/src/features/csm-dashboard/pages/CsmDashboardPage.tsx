/**
 * Top-level CSM dashboard. The dashboard list is BE-driven (`GET
 * /dashboards`), and the initial selection depends on the signed-in user's
 * own ABT team membership (`GET /users/me`'s `team`, via `useCurrentUser`):
 * a user WITH a resolved team defaults to the first `isTeamBased` dashboard
 * in the list (with that team auto-selected — see `selectedTeamId` below);
 * a user with no team defaults to the BE's own `isDefault` entry, same as
 * before this distinction existed. The URL always wins over both defaults
 * when it names a (valid) dashboard — see `parseDashboardHash`.
 *
 * Dashboards are selected purely by dropdown — there is no other
 * per-dashboard scoping control. Every dashboard in the registry has at
 * least one real (config-driven) widget, so this always renders the real
 * widget grid.
