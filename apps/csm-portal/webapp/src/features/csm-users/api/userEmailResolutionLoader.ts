/**
 * Module-level batching ("dataloader") for resolving a user's canonical id
 * from their email via `POST /users/search`. A case-detail page can carry
 * dozens of actors (comments, attachments, activity entries, watchers) with
 * `id: null` on their {@link UserReference} — one per hook consumer would be
 * an N+1 request storm. Instead, every email requested within a short window
 * is collected here and resolved with a single search call, then the
 * per-email result is handed back to each caller's own `useQuery` (see
 * `useResolvedUserId`), so react-query's own per-key cache still dedupes and
 * reuses the mapping across the rest of the session.
 *
 * `/users/search`'s `emails` filter caps at 50 entries, so a batch larger
 * than that is split into chunks — vanishingly unlikely on a single page, but
 * cheap to guard against.
