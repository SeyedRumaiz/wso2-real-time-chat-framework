 * Ends a live-engineer-chat session: POST /chat/sessions/{caseId}/complete
 * (see csm-portal/backend's internal/handler/chat.go
 * HandleCompleteSession). Notifies other engineers and drops the customer
 * back to Novera-only chat. Deliberately does not change the case's own
 * state — resolving the underlying issue is still a separate, explicit step
 * on the normal case detail page.
 *
 * This also releases the engineer's routing-service capacity for this one
 * case server-side (see the 2026-09-10 concurrent-chat-capacity change --
 * chat_status itself is untouched, since it's now a plain manual toggle
 * independent of case load) — but the response here doesn't say whether
 * that immediately backfilled another queued case, so the status/case-list
 * query is invalidated rather than optimistically set, letting it refetch
 * the real outcome instead of going stale.
