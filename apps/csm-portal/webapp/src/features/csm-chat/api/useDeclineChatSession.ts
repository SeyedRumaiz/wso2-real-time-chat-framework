/**
 * Declines a live-engineer-chat alert before accepting it: POST
 * /chat/sessions/{caseId}/decline (see csm-portal/backend's
 * internal/handler/chat.go HandleDeclineSession). Necessary now that
 * escalations are routed to exactly one engineer at a time instead of
 * broadcast to all of them (see that backend's chat-routing-service
 * integration) — without this call, dismissing an alert would silently
 * strand the customer with nobody else ever seeing their request. The
 * backend re-routes the case to another available engineer, or requeues
 * it if none are free; this call does not need to know which happened.
 *
 * Declining releases the SAME routing-service capacity accepting would
 * have (you hold this case, and it counts toward your concurrent-chat
 * capacity, the moment an escalation routes to you — before you've clicked
 * anything, see the 2026-09-10 concurrent-chat-capacity change) — so this
 * also invalidates the status/case-list query the same way completing a
 * session does, rather than leaving it stuck listing a case that's no
 * longer yours.
