// Shared Playwright test helpers. Auth is by replaying a captured browser
// session — no login page is driven. The Asgardeo React SDK keeps its tokens in
// **sessionStorage** (session_data-instance_… etc.), which Playwright's
// storageState does not restore, so we replay both localStorage and
// sessionStorage via an init script that runs before the app boots. A file is
// skipped (not failed) when its role's session bundle hasn't been captured.
