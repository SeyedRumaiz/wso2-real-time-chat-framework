# Customer Portal E2E (Playwright, local)

Scaffolding only — **no specs yet**. Runs locally against `pnpm run dev`
(:3000), authenticated by a **captured browser session** so no login page or
2FA is driven. See [`auth/README.md`](./auth/README.md) to capture one.

There is no mock backend here: specs will hit the same backend the dev server
is configured against (`public/config.js`), so anything a spec creates is a
**real record** in that environment. Tag created data so it stays identifiable.

## Run

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e                          # all specs (boots dev server)
node_modules/.bin/playwright test --ui     # author/debug interactively
node_modules/.bin/playwright show-report   # open the last HTML report
```

> Note: `pnpm exec playwright …` fails in this repo ("packages field missing");
> call the binary directly via `node_modules/.bin/playwright …`.

Environment switches (see `playwright.config.ts`):

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `E2E_BASE_URL` | Target a deployed environment instead of `http://localhost:3000` |
| `E2E_NO_WEBSERVER=1` | Don't boot the dev server (use with `E2E_BASE_URL`) |
| `CI` | `forbidOnly`, and never reuse an already-running dev server |

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `auth/README.md` | How to capture a session bundle (localStorage + sessionStorage) |
| `fixtures/test.ts` | `withRole(test, role)` replays a session, skipping each test that uses it when the bundle is absent (it skips from `beforeEach`, so tests are reported individually as skipped rather than the file being skipped as a unit); `openContextAs(browser, role)` opens a second authenticated context |
| `pages/` | Page objects — one per screen, no assertions inside |
| `specs/` | The specs, grouped in subfolders by feature area |
| `utils/` | Shared selectors / data-tagging helpers |
| `storageState/` | Captured session bundles — **git-ignored, real tokens** |

## Roles

`PortalRole` in `fixtures/test.ts` is `"admin" | "lead" | "portal" | "security"`,
matching the portal's user types. Capabilities are split across two sources, so
a test account needs both set correctly:

- **admin** — both the ServiceNow user role `sn_customerservice.customer_admin`
  (read from `GET /users/me`), which gates Settings user management and
  registry service tokens, **and** an Admin membership on the project under
  test.
- **lead / portal / security** — project **membership** flags (`isLead`,
  `isPortalUser`, `isSecurityContact`) on the project under test, read from the
  project contacts list.

Project-level feature visibility (Operations, Security Center, Updates,
Engagements, Usage & Metrics …) is independent of all of these — it comes from
`GET /projects/{id}/features`. Pick the project a spec runs against
accordingly.
