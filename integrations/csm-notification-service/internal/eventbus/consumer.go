// handleAttempts is how many times a single record's Handle func is called
// in total before giving up on it — not additional retries on top of a first
// call, so handleAttempts=3 means 3 calls, 2 of them retries. A record that
// still fails after this many attempts is handed to OnExhausted (see Run) —
// typically published to a dead-letter topic rather than dropped — and its
// offset is committed anyway either way, so one permanently-failing record
// (e.g. a downstream outage) cannot block every later record on its
// partition forever. The DLQ topic's own Consumer uses the same
// handleAttempts/handleRetryDelay for its own retry pass over a
// dead-lettered record (see cmd/server/main.go) — there is deliberately no
// third tier past that: an OnExhausted of nil there just logs and drops.
